# NUS-ModFinder

Given the mods you've taken in NUS, finds all the modules you're eligible to take. From all faculties!
(This README will be rewritten in more detail soon.)

## Getting it running

1. Clone the repo to a location of your choice, on your personal machine. (Always a good start.)
2. Make a copy of modules_taken.txt on the root folder of the repository. (i.e. the same level as main.py).
3. Fill up all the modules you've taken in NUS in modules_taken.txt, with one module on each line.
4. Run main.py in your Terminal/Command Line. i.e.`python3 main.py`
5. Profit!

## Have a nice day :-)
